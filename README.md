# Requirements:
- cmake 3.22+

# Building (with bmgui):
```bash
# Build
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DBUILD_BMGUI=ON
make -j4
```

# Running bmgui
```bash
# OPTION 1.)
# App will prompt you for privilege elevation to set caps on bmgui `cap_net_raw` and `cap_net_admin`
# After setting the caps, it will relaunch the app. This is necessary to use raw sockets and promiscuous mode
./app/bmgui/bmgui

# OPTION 2.)
# Set permissions manually and then run app
# NOTE: You only need to do this once 
sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip ./app/bmgui/bmgui && ./app/bmgui/bmgui 

# OPTION 3.)
# Just run as root
sudo ./app/bmgui/bmgui

# TODO(Charles): Optimization: Eventually need to find where I wrote down what had to be done for namespaces and routing rules (per my forum post):
# Using Linux network namespaces to isolate the network device from other applications in the system. This stops certain types of traffic from leaking onto the interface, like broadcast and multicast packets from various services and discovery protocols.
# Applying a few additional routing table rules to prevent built-in IPv6 traffic generated by the kernel itself from leaking onto the network (like ICMPv6 neighbor discovery, which we replace with BCMP neighbor discovery).
```

# Getting started with bmgui
- Set a node ID and any other required initial configuration
- Start the node instance
- Add network interfaces (these map to BM NetDevices)
 - This will eventually support Serial/SPI/other netdevice types as well
- Enable NetDevices and their individual Ports
- BM L2 will automatically start interacting with any active NetDevices
- BCMP will automatically interact with BM L2 (even if there are no active NetDevices, packets will just get dropped in the void)
- Functions and data become available in Activity-specific tabs in main view
 - Heartbeats
 - Neighbor discovery
 - Topology discovery
